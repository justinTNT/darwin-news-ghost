We need the bond to &#xA0;protect the river and our country if something goes wrong,&#x201D; he said.</p><p>&#x201C;The &#xA0;bond wasn&#x2019;t high enough before &#x2014; it needed to be doubled at least. I &#xA0;couldn&#x2019;t believe it when I heard that the minister up in &#xAD;Darwin decided &#xA0;to cut it.&#x201D;</p><p>Casey Davey, a traditional &#xA0;owner of areas near the mine, said reducing the bond made him angry. &#xA0;&#x201C;We need to know our community will be protected in the future,&#x201D; he &#xA0;said.</p><p>The McArthur River Mine in the &#xA0;Gulf of Carpentaria has been dogged by controversy since it was &#xA0;converted from underground to open-cut in the 2000s. In 2007, &#xA0;traditional owners won a court battle against the project, but the &#xA0;Martin government legislated to override that decision three days later. &#xA0;Three Labor MPs crossed the floor at the time.</p><p>Former federal Labor environment minister Peter Garrett approved the open-cut conversion.</p><p>The &#xA0;project has been opposed by NT Labor senator Malarndirri McCarthy and &#xA0;by Northern Land Council chief executive Marion Scrymgour when she was &#xA0;an MP.</p><p>Ms Scrymgour is tipped as a candidate to replace retiring Labor MP Warren Snowdon.</p><p>Kirsty &#xA0;Howey, head of the Environment Centre NT, said her &#xAD;organisation was &#xA0;backing the case because &#x201C;the regulation of this mine is a national &#xA0;scandal&#x201D;.</p><p>&#x201C;The risks are escalating &#xA0;every year, and the mine and the Northern Territory government simply &#xA0;can&#x2019;t keep pace with what&#x2019;s unfolding,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re talking about &#xA0;the potential destruction of an entire river system that has &#xAD;sustained &#xA0;Aboriginal people in the region for 65,000 years.</p><p>&#x201C;Apart &#xA0;from the damage to the McArthur River, it is financial mismanagement by &#xA0;the Northern Territory government. Ultimately, it&#x2019;s the Northern &#xA0;Territory government, and Australian taxpayers, that will be liable to &#xA0;pay for the clean-up if the mine doesn&#x2019;t.&#x201D;</p><p>David &#xA0;Morris, chief executive of the Environmental Defenders&#x2019; Office and a &#xA0;lawyer working on the case, said regional communities were losing trust &#xA0;in the NT government.</p><p>&#x201C;The mine has &#xA0;created a 1000-year problem in 10 years, and the government has allowed &#xA0;that to occur,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Northern development cannot occur in a way &#xA0;that is blind to future impacts, future costs and future burdens, which &#xA0;will disproportionately rest with regional communities. This case &#xA0;doesn&#x2019;t seek to shut the mine down. It is about ensuring the Territory &#xA0;has enough money to fix up the mine site if the company did walk away, &#xA0;and protecting the community.&#x201D;</p><p>The &#xA0;federal approval for McArthur River Mine has effect until 3019. Mining &#xA0;operations are expected to continue for about 16 years until 2037 and &#xA0;tailings to be reprocessed until 2048.</p><p>A &#xA0;spokeswoman for Ms Manison said the decision to reduce the size of the &#xA0;security bond had been made after a rigorous independent assessment &#xA0;process and was in line with legislation. Glencore did not provide &#xA0;comment.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Gunner kicks MLA out of caucus]]></title><description><![CDATA[Despite only yesterday claiming it was just a rumour unworthy of his attention, Mr Gunner today recommended labor caucus remove the member for Blain.]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/gunner-kicks-mla-out-of-caucus/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">63d7253d6be5f4225c8f4d33</guid><category><![CDATA[gunner]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Staff Writers]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 18 Feb 2021 07:44:09 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/cantfindme/2021/02/gunna.png" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/cantfindme/2021/02/gunna.png" alt="Gunner kicks MLA out of caucus"><p>The curse of Blain strikes again!</p><p>The electorate formerly represented by dick-pic wanker Nathan Barret is currently held by another</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/cantfindme/2021/02/image-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="Gunner kicks MLA out of caucus" loading="lazy"><figcaption>not worth a comment.</figcaption></figure><p>Writing in the local paper (NT News, a foreign merde-och owned paper caught up in facebook&apos;s aus-media ban), brilliant darwin journalist Marduk McCormack writes:</p><p>&quot;BLAIN MLA Mark Turner will be &#xA0;removed from caucus, Chief Minister Michael Gunner has revealed, saying &#xA0;the MLA had &#x201C;lost my trust&#x201D; and the trust of the Labor government.&quot;</p><p>According to McCormack, Mr &#xA0;Gunner said he had spoken to Mr Turner through the week but it had come &#xA0;to his attention that the first term parliamentarian had not been &#xA0;&#x201C;completely forthcoming&#x201D; with him or his colleagues.</p><p>Well, that&apos;s funny, because just yesterday Mr Gunner said it was just a rumour and not worthy of his comment.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[weather]]></title><description><![CDATA[the past week's extreme temperatures exceed natural variability.]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/weather/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">63d7253d6be5f4225c8f4d32</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Staff Writers]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 22 Dec 2019 04:59:36 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>it&apos;s been hot.</p><p>it&apos;s been getting hotter this century, but this year is something else.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/cantfindme/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-22-at-2.28.53-pm.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p></p><p>Summer just started, and it&apos;s too early to crunch the numbers, but the past week&apos;s extreme temperatures - including successive broken records for highest ever national average - exceed the predictable variability, indicating a climate factor.</p><p>If the dust settles and the statisticians can indeed &apos;see&apos; a climate change fingerprint in the summer&apos;s weather, it suggests that further impacts are already &apos;locked in&apos;.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Workplace death]]></title><description><![CDATA[NT police report a 23-year-old man has died in a workplace incident in Palmerston on Friday.]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/workplace-death/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">63d7253d6be5f4225c8f4d31</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Staff Writers]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 22 Dec 2019 04:23:22 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NT police report a 23-year-old man has died in a workplace incident in Palmerston on Friday.</p><p>The 23-year-old was killed by electrocution while working in the suburb of Rosebery.
